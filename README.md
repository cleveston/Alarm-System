Alarm System using MQTT 
 
This project will be an implementation of a home alarm system using a Raspberry Pi 
and some presence sensors. Each room of the residence will have a presence sensor, all of  
them connected to a central. 
The central sends the sensorâ€™s data to Amazon's AWS servers through the MQTT 
protocol. To this end, the central will be programmed using JavaScript, with the NodeJs 
technology. Communication with Amazon's servers will be performed through an Amazon 
API for IoT, using wired or wireless network. 
The owners of the residence can view in real time the status of their home as well as 
enable or disable the alarm. All this from their Android mobile phone, which will act as a  
remote control for the alarm system. 
When an intruder breaking into the house, the central detects and sends a message to 
Amazon's servers. The owner of the house at the same moment, is notified of the invasion.
